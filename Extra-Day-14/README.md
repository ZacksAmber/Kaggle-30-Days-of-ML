# Extra Day 14

## [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)

- Tutorial: The link of Kaggle tutorial.
- Course Content: Almost the same content from Tutorial, maybe I added a little change. You can run it on your local machine.
- Exercise: My exercise answer from Kaggle course exercise. You cannot run it on your local machine.

### Clustering with K-Means

> [Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/ryanholbrook/clustering-with-k-means)<br>
> [Course Content](https://github.com/ZacksAmber/Kaggle-30-Days-of-ML/blob/main/Extra-Day-14/clustering-with-k-means.ipynb)<br>
> [Exercise](https://github.com/ZacksAmber/Kaggle-30-Days-of-ML/blob/main/Extra-Day-14/exercise-clustering-with-k-means.ipynb)

Some features are meaningless for ML. For example, longitude and latitude are just numbers, and they have unlimited combinations. However, if we can identify their clusters, the *area (longitude & latitude)* is meaningful for prediction.
