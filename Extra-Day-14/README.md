# Extra Day 14

## [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)

- Tutorial: The link of Kaggle tutorial.
- Course Content: Almost the same content from Tutorial, maybe I added a little change. You can run it on your local machine.
- Exercise: My exercise answer from Kaggle course exercise. You cannot run it on your local machine.
